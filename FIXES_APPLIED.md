## 🎉 **API Issues Fixed!**

The error `ApiService.getPurchases is not a function` has been resolved. Here's what was fixed:

### **🔧 What was the problem?**
- The `ApiService.getPurchases()` and `ApiService.getPayments()` methods were missing from the frontend API service
- The suppliers page was trying to call these methods but they didn't exist

### **✅ What was fixed?**

1. **Added missing API methods:**
   - `ApiService.getPurchases()` - Fetches purchase orders
   - `ApiService.getPayments()` - Fetches payment records
   - `ApiService.createPurchase()` - Creates new purchase orders
   - `ApiService.createPayment()` - Creates new payment records
   - `ApiService.updatePurchase()` - Updates existing purchases
   - `ApiService.deletePayment()` - Deletes payment records

2. **Fixed TypeScript errors:**
   - Updated type definitions for file upload handling
   - Added proper error handling for API responses
   - Added fallback empty arrays for failed API calls

3. **Improved file upload handling:**
   - Fixed proof document upload logic
   - Added proper file URL generation
   - Handled File objects correctly in form submissions

4. **Enhanced error handling:**
   - Added try-catch blocks for each API call
   - Graceful fallbacks when API calls fail
   - Better user feedback with notifications

### **🚀 Now your project should work correctly!**

#### **To test the fixes:**

1. **Build the frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   cd ..
   ./deploy.sh  # On server
   # or
   ./dev-start.sh  # For local development
   ```

3. **Test the suppliers page:**
   - Navigate to `/dashboard/suppliers`
   - Check that purchases and payments load without errors
   - Try creating new purchase orders and payments

### **🔍 Backend Requirements:**
Make sure your Django backend has these endpoints available:
- `GET /api/purchases/` - List purchases
- `POST /api/purchases/` - Create purchase
- `GET /api/payments/` - List payments  
- `POST /api/payments/` - Create payment

The backend should already have these configured based on your Django models and ViewSets.

### **📊 Expected Results:**
- No more "getPurchases is not a function" errors
- Suppliers page loads completely
- Purchase and payment forms work correctly
- File uploads are handled properly
